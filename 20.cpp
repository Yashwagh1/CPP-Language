/*WHY OOPS
1. C++ language was designed with the main intension of adding oriented feature to c language 
2. As the size of the program increase, readabiity, maintainability and bug free nature of pragram decrease 
3.this was the major problem with language like a c which relied upon function or procedure (hence the name procedural programming language)
4.as a result , the possibility of not adressing the problem in an offctive manner was high 
5.also as data was almost neglected , data security was easily compromised
6.using classes solve this problem by modeling program as a real world scenario


PROCEDURE ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

Consists of writing a set of instructions for the computer to follow

Main focus is on functions and not on flow of data

Functions can either use local or global data

* Data moves openly from function to function

OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
Works on the concept of classes and objects

* A class is a template to create objects

Treats data as a critical element

Decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around the object



BASIC CONCEPTS IN OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

Classes - Basic template for creating objects.

Objects - Basic run time entities.

Data Abstraction & Encapsulation - Wrapping data and functions into single unit.

Inheritance - Properties of one class can be inherited into others.

Polymorphism - ability to take more than one forms.

Dynamic Binding code which will execute is not known until the program. runs.

Message Passing - Object.message (Information) call format.*/
